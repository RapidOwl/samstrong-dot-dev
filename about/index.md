## Who am I?

I'm a full-stack* software developer and team lead based in Nottingham, England, with a passion for reducing friction in back-office applications, who mostly lives in the .Net and JavaScript worlds.

<sub>\* I'm comfortable writing server-side and client-side code and spend a non-zero amount of time attempting to cram design skills into my brain.</sub>

## I believe in

- ✨ Cross-functional teams
- 🎭 Working through others
- 🧙‍♂️ Doing more by doing less
- ⏱ Shipping small and shipping often
- 🎆 Iterating to success

Writing code is a means to an end. That end is solving the problems that stand in the way of my employer achieving their goals.

I prefer the simplest approach possible that results in a scalable, extensible and maintainable product, especially when the approach requires no code to be written at all. We're all working to a limited timescale and every problem we side-step is time we get back to work on the next big challenge.

I love coaching and supporting other team members and consider this a critical skill in every developers arsenal. Caring for your colleagues allows you to act as a force-multiplier, helping them improve their own skills and optimise their approach while keeping them happy and optimistic.

## My approach

### Be kind

Treating people badly gets you nowhere anyone should ever want to go. Kindness and consideration are superpowers.

### Be bold

Seeing a positive outcome from a challenging situation helps erase that little bit more anxiety.

### It's just a rock

Code has no feelings. It isn't out to get you. The only attitude you bring to it is your own.

### Do the work

Nothing just happens. If you want anything to change, you need to put in the effort.

### Value yourself

Be kind to youself. Accept compliments. Value your time. Say, "you're welcome" instead of "no worries".

### Find balance

Seek balance between work and relaxation, technology and art, busy work and creativity.
