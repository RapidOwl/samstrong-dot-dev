## Who am I?

<img src="/img/coffee-sipping.jpg" style="border-radius: 50%;" alt="" />

I'm a full-stack\* software developer and Tech Lead based in Nottingham, who spends most of his time in the .Net and JavaScript worlds, but is extremely passionate about CSS in general.

<sub>\* I'm comfortable writing server-side and client-side code and spend a non-zero amount of time attempting to cram design skills into my brain.</sub>

## I believe in

- ✨ Cross-functional teams
- 🎭 Working through others
- 🧙‍♂️ Doing more by doing less
- ⏱ Shipping small and shipping often
- 🎆 Iterating to success

Writing code is a means to an end. That end is solving the problems that stand in the way of my employer achieving their goals. Writing code is also expensive so we should always make sure we're building the right thing, in the right way at the right time.

I prefer the simplest approach possible that results in a scalable, extensible and maintainable product, especially when the approach requires no code to be written at all. We're all working to a limited timescale and every problem we side-step is time we get back to work on the next thing.

I love coaching and supporting other team members and consider this a critical skill in every developer's repertoire. Caring for your colleagues allows you to act as a force-multiplier, helping them improve their own skills, ask the right questions and optimise their approach while keeping them happy and optimistic.

## My approach

### Be kind

Treating people badly gets you nowhere anyone should ever want to go. Kindness and consideration are superpowers.

### Be bold

Seeing a positive outcome from a challenging situation helps erase that little bit more anxiety.

### It's just a rock

Code has no feelings. It isn't out to get you. The only attitude you bring to it is your own.

### Do the work

Nothing just happens. If you want anything to change, you need to put in the effort.

### Value yourself

Be kind to youself. Accept compliments. Value your time. Say, "you're welcome" instead of "no worries".

### Find balance

Seek balance between work and relaxation, technology and art, busy work and creativity.
