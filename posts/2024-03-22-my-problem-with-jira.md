Jira is everywhere. Every so often I hear about a team using Asana, Trello, Linear or even Miro, but there seems to be a point in every company's life where it reaches a certain size and Jira just inserts itself. A bit like how casettes in a car become copies of Queen's Greatest Hits (except Queen were incredible).

The thing is, Jira really doesn't fit in with what I think is the best way to work. I believe teams should drive initiatives, rather than being tied to projects. A given team might work on many little projects connected to different initiatives and the progress of the overall intiative is where we see our achievements.

The problem is that Jira conflates projects with boards and teams. In order to maintain a semblance of sanity, a team tends to want a single board to work from. Jira connects boards to projects by default. If you want to bring in epics from other projects, you need to either import them into your project or alter your board's query in order to include other projects (or even ticket types). At which point you get everything.

Imagine going to Jira, creating a board and finding there is no project or any tickets. Instead there's a menu where you can easily reach into other projects and pull in epics for your team to work on. The initiatives are just over there for visualisation of progress and planning. I think that'd be nice. I think that would be less awkward.
